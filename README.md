# WebApp_Project

## INTRODUCTION

Project developed for the Web and Mobile Application Programming exam. 
The project consists in the development of a Website for a hairdresser, where, in addition to basic information, 
it is possible to have an account and make reservations. 

Moreover, Customers (registered users) have the option of requesting a Card like Fidelity Card, to accumulate points and 
redeem prizes issued by the Holder or Employees. 
In fact, Holder and Employees also have access to the platform, and have the ability to manage their Customers, 
view bookings, add points to Customers and other features.
